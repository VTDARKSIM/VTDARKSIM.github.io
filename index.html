    <p>Fuck fascists and billionaires in their near-perfect overlapping Venn diagram circles.</p>
    <p>Things I recommend:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Get off centralized social media</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Download your Twitter/X data and delete your account. Just do it. Dude is a straight up nazi.</li>
            <li>Download your Facebook data and delete your account. At a minimum deactivate it.</li>
            <li>Get off TikTok. That's either going away or will become an American propaganda machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Join decentralized social media. There are lots of options in the federated universe, i.e. <a href=https://simplyexplained.com/videos/mastodon-and-fediverse-explained/">"the Fediverse"</a>.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>: Similar to Twitter but with far fewer nazis.</li>
            <li><a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>: Similar to Instagram but not owned by a billionaire.</li>
            <li><a href="https://loops.video/">Loops</a>: In beta right now, but poised to become a decentralized version of TikTok.</li>
            <li><a href="https://friendi.ca/">Friendica</a>: The closest thing to Facebook, but it admittedly is pretty far from being ready for mainstream.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.funkwhale.audio/">Funkwhale</a>: A music-sharing service. It's certainly not perfect but it might suit your needs.</li>
            <li><a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">Peertube</a>: Similar to YouTube.</li>
            <li><a href="https://fediverse.info/explore/projects">Others</a>: There are a bunch more options out there, so explore and see what you like! The best part is all these platforms are federated, meaning they can interact with each other!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Protect your data!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off listening devices</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn off the "Hey Siri" and "Hey Alexa" functions on your devices. Apple already settled a lawsuit about them listening in on users without their knowledge.</li>
                <li>I distrust my Alexa so much I stashed it in the garage far from any conversations.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Web browsing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete Chrome and use a privacy-focused browser like Firefox.</li>
                <li>Use plugins like uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger to hamper sites from tracking you.</li>
                <li>Stop using Google. DuckDuckGo is a good alternative I've been using for a couple years now.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Communicate securely</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Invest in a Virtual Private Network (VPN). There are a ton out there, but I've been using Proton VPN and love it. I have it on my phone, iPad, computers, and even our home router, so our identity online is masked.</li>
                <li>iChats are encrypted but I am skeptical of Apple's long-term resistance to authoritarianism. Consider Signal, which is an open-source messaging app that has world-class encryption capabilities.</li>
                <li>You should assume your emails are being read by someone, as there's no security on them. Especially Gmail, since Google spies on you. Consider an encrypted email service like Proton Mail or Tuta Mail.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Consider using a password manager.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I have been using Bitwarden for the last two years or so and have been pleased. I can create complex passwords that autofill on my computer and phone, and don't need to remember them.</li>
                <li>I also have access to Proton Pass as a Proton customer, offering similar features. The UI isn't as clean, but it does allow me to create email aliases (like the one above) to hide my real email address.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Back up your data and encrypt it.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I subscribed to Ente, a photo service that backs up photos from your phone and computer, encrypts them end-to-end, and stores them remotely.</li>
                <li>Drop Google Drive and use something more secure like Proton Drive. It's not as seamless as GD, but it encrypts your files end-to-end.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Use other open-source software to protect your data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Get rid of Google Maps and Apple Maps. Try Here WeGo, Organic Maps, or OnTheGoMap.com. They are open-source, don't collect data, and are viable alternatives to the first two depending on your use case.</li>
                <li>I'm told the <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice Suite</a> is a nice alternative to Microsoft Office, but I have not tried it myself. It's on my to-do list.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Shop ethically!</li>
        It's time we stop giving money to companies who advocate for voter suppression, harmful policies, or outright fascism. We should support local, ethical, environmentally-friendly businesses instead!
        <ul>
            <li>Delete your Amazon account. You don't need it, really. I wavered on this for about a year until I just decided to do it one day, and I'm happier for it.</li>
            <li>Stop using Google (a common thread, if you haven't noticed it already). There are a bunch of alternatives to their suite of tools.</li>
            <li>Don't support Home Depot or Lowes if you can help it. I just started going to my local Ace Hardware store, which is locally-owned, and they can meet most of my needs.</li>
            <li>Shop local if you can. Yes it is easier to order something from your phone, but keeping money local is much better for your community.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get plugged in!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There's a ton of horrible news out there these days, so much so it's easy to get overwhelmed. Find something you enjoy and make it a regular habit to do it.</li>
            <li>Join a local group, book club, sports team, whatever.</li>
            <li>Pick a cause or causes you believe in and give recurring donations if you have the ability!</li>
            <li>Lastly, don't be an asshole. Life is hard enough, don't make it harder for others. Unless they're nazis.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
